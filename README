How to create a self-extracting archive using CSFX

* put all your files into a standard uncompressed tarball
* create sfxdata.rc, containing these lines
     SFXDATA RCDATA "your_archive.tar"
     STRINGTABLE BEGIN
         23 "a_bootstrap_program.exe"
     END
  (you can omit the last three lines, in which case an explorer.exe window
  will be opened showing the temporary folder)
* run 'make'
* optionally compress the produced executable with UPX
